# Project

This is a repo of all things DevOps. I'm trying to create from scratch technologies I don't normally work with at work. 

- Ansbile (side note: I do use Ansible at work, but don't normally use it for cloud.)
- Cloudformation
- Terraform
- Vagrant
- Web (Trying to create diffent web applications in this folder)

I know this is a work in progress, but am excited to learn and add more to this repo. Also, I want to be more active with GitHub!
