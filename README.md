# Project

This is a repo of all things DevOps. I'm trying to create from scratch, all the tools I don't normally work with at work. 

- Ansbile (side note: I do use Ansible at work, but don't normally use it for cloud.)
- Cloudformation
- Terraform
- Vagrant
- Web (Trying to create diffent web applications in this folder and get back to basic in web development.)

I know this is a work in progress, but I'm excited to learn and add more to this repo. Also, I just want to be more active with GitHub!
